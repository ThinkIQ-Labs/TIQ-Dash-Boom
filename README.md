# TIQ-Dash-Boom

TIQ-Dash-Boom is an open type-based dashboarding framework for the SMIP. Dashboards can be created by instantiating an instance of the dashboard type anywhere in the instance tree.

Dashboard instances have a type-based display script that will let you configure a real-time dashboard using widgets available to you. First widgets include title, value right now, and sparkline.

Widgets can be organized in other libraries. Widgets available in the premium vision add-on library include media, sparkline from vision and grid from vision widgets.
