# TIQ-Dash-Boom

TIQ-Dash-Boom is an open type-based dashboarding framework for the SMIP. Dashboards can be created by instantiating an instance of the dashboard type anywhere in the instance tree.

Dashboard instances have a type-based display script that will let you configure a real-time dashboard using widgets available to you. First open widgets available in this library include title, value right now, and sparkline.

Widgets can be created using inheritance and organized in other propriatary libraries. For instance, widgets available in the vision add-on library include media, sparkline from vision and grid from vision widgets.
